# Hardware Setup
My first steps was to install and configure Proxmox VE onto my machine. After the succesfully installation I needed to find and install drivers for the tp-link AX1800 archer TX20U nano wifi dongle. The proxmox team does not recomended using WLAN  becuase it requires work arounds to use them as bride interfaces and are not as reliable as ethernet connections, however it is my only option for an internet connection.


- finding USB dongle drivers for linux is a challenge
- installation and configuration of drivers is as well
